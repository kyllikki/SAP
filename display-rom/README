bingen tool
===========

This tool generates binary bit patterns suitable for flashing to an
EEPROM. The pattern can be used in a time multiplexed display to
generate decimal display of a binary value on seven segment outputs.

The generated defaults use 8kbits for each decode. The binary value is
presented on address lines A0 to A7, the binary display position on A8
and A9 (8kbit). Additional bits select different decoding schemes.

The default decoding scheme (A10->AXX = 0) is a simple unsigned
decimal display. asserting A10 allows for signed twos compliment display.
Additional decoding schemes for larger EEPROM could easily be added if
required.

usage
-----

build the tool with make

   make

run bingen with an output filename to create the bit pattern

   ./bingen 28c16.bin

The binary file can then be programmed into an EEPROM programmer as desired

For conveniance a pre-generated 28c16.bin is provided
